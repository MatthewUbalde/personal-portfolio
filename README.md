# Matthew Ubalde's Personal Portfolio

## Introduction
Hello! My name is Matthew Ubalde and I'm a part of Fanshawe's Computer Programming and Analysis program. I some experiences in Software Development using C/C++, C#, and Java through the program. And in addition, I have experience in Web Development through Vue and React.

Actually, this whole website is built from React, TS, and Vanilla CSS.

## What's inside the site?
There are two sections of the site, one with my portfolio in Computer Development and the other in the Art field. 

### Computer Development Portfolio
In the first side, it has most of my projects that are related to the Computer Development field. All of them (should) have examples in

- Software Development (C/C++, Java, C#)
- Game Development (made in Godot)
- Web Development (Some made in React)
- And possibly much more!

These examples (should have) bits code, video showcases, and much more. 

(Obviously, as of Nov. 8, 2023, not everything is in there as the website is in development!)

### Art Portfolio
In the other side, however, it has most of my projects related to the Artistic field. Things things you can find in here are:

- Illustrations
- 3D Modelling
- Studies
- And much more!

These examples (should have) bits of sketches, video showcases, blog posts, and much more. 

## Conclusion

I made this website to demostrate my ability to create a React website, and my ability to adapt and learn along my way as I develop this. It will continually be in development as I learn new things from the Internet and much more.

I have tons of fun making this website, and I hope I get to showcase the skills of what I can do.

Thank you so much!
